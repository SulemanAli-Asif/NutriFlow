                            The first Premium subscription charge on your credit card will be after the trial. Once the trial ends, your subscription will auto-renew unless you cancel. If you purchased a monthly subscription, you will be charged every month. If you purchased an annual subscription, you will be charged every year.

                            <br />
                            Simply log the foods you eat using one of our easy food tracking tools, and we'll show you a complete nutritional breakdown for each food, meal, day, and even week. Any way you want to look at your data, you'll gain a better understanding of your personal nutrition so you can make smart choices that align with your weight, health, and fitness goals.

                        Does Eterna Vitality use a BMI calculator or BMR calculator to
                        set goals?

                    <div className="collapse-content">
                        <p>
                            Yes, Eterna Vitality uses a BMR calculator to help you set calorie goals. During signup, you'll be asked questions about your height, weight, age, and sex to estimate your BMR (basal metabolic rate). You can also estimate your own BMR with our BMR calculator.
                            <br />
                            The equation used to calculate BMR is called the Mifflin St. Jeor equation* and it takes into account your typical activity level during the day to calculate your daily calorie needs. Depending on your weight goals, we either add or subtract calories from your daily calorie needs (500 calories per pound of weight change per week desired).
                            <br />
                            To help you set safe weight goals during signup, we use a BMI calculator. BMI is based on the ratio of your weight to your height, and we don't allow you to set weight goals below a certain ratio.
                            <br />
                            *The Mifflin St. Jeor equation is considered to be the best estimation of calorie needs compared to other equations, being able to get within 10% of your actual energy needs on average.

                            Yes! The best thing about Eterna Vitality is that it's an all-in-one app. You don't need a separate intermittent fasting app, or different apps for water tracking, weight tracking, or fitness tracking.
